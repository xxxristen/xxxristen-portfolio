                An unintentional DIY-er, I&#39;m curious and like to discover how
                things work. Often regarded as an detail-oriented individual and also
                having worked on the client-side, I&#39;m able to put on the
                client and user&#39;s hats while working on projects, allowing me to anticipate
                and identify gaps.
